*An independent, collaborative mathematical notebook inspired by the Scottish Café of Lwów.*

**Can humans and AI systems collaborate to formulate new mathematical problems of lasting significance?** This collection explores that question through precise formulations, prior-art comparison, independent criticism, proofs, counterexamples and reproducible computation.

The [Scottish Book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-22897-6), kept at the Scottish Café in Lwów beginning in 1935, recorded mathematical questions and occasionally offered prizes for solutions. This contemporary collection follows its tradition of accessible, collaborative problem formulation. It is independent of the original historical notebook and its successors.

Many entries were developed through **human–AI collaboration**. Mathematical validity and historical priority must be assessed independently of provenance. Human-only contributions are equally welcome. See [provenance and credit](PROVENANCE.md). **Contributions are welcome.**

**[Propose a problem with a simple form](https://github.com/gsidoine/the-scottish-book/issues/new?template=propose-problem.yml)** · [Browse the searchable book](https://gsidoine.github.io/the-scottish-book/) · [Contribute a proof or correction](CONTRIBUTING.md) · [Symbolic rewards](REWARDS.md)

The collection also retains a historical encouragement to problem formulation:

> “The purpose of life is to prove and to conjecture.” — Paul Erdős ([MacTutor, University of St Andrews](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Erdos/quotations/))

This collection currently contains **50 numbered research entries (P001–P050)**. New proposals do not receive a permanent identifier until reviewed.

## Catalogue

[Complete numbered catalogue](#problem-catalogue) · [Mathematical status](#status-and-scope) · [Prizes and historical designations](REWARDS.md) · [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md)

The catalogue contains all numbered entries in a single sequence. Mathematical formulation and the assessment of historical novelty are recorded separately. A reward, where specified, is a symbolic designation with an explicit condition; it does not measure difficulty, originality, or importance.

## Status and scope

| Status | Entries | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| Candidate | 38 | Precisely defined open question with a substantive unresolved mathematical target; novelty is not certified |
| Reframe | 8 (P007, P009, P012, P013, P025, P029, P032, P037) | A predecessor or insufficiently independent target requires a stronger mathematical formulation |
| Needs specification | 2 (P008, P022) | A sharper quantified problem or nontrivial asymptotic target is required |
| Proved internally | 1 (P010) | Exact theorem kernel-checked in Lean 4; journal review and historical priority remain separate |
| Known result | 1 (P048) | The statement is resolved by established mathematics; retained to preserve its permanent identifier |

Computational verification establishes only the stated finite cases. An internal proof is not a claim of verified historical novelty. The full collection is open to mathematical corrections and independent assessments.

## Symbolic rewards

The original Scottish Book included prizes associated with particular questions, including prizes depending on the kind of solution. This collection uses four [modern symbolic designations](REWARDS.md)—A Coffee, A Book, A Dinner, and A Research Prize—while preserving the historically documented prizes and previous assignments. They form no scale of difficulty or prestige. The catalogue distinguishes symbolic, pledged, funded, and awarded states; every current assignment is **symbolic**, and **no physical prize is presently offered**. A dash in the catalogue denotes no assigned reward.

## Manuscript record

**[P010 — Minimum coprime adjacencies](problems/graph-theory/P010-minimum-coprime-adjacencies.md)** has a [complete Lean-verified exact theorem](formal/P010/README.md), checked without nonfoundational axioms. The [submitted manuscript](manuscripts/P010/coprime_adjacencies.pdf) was submitted to the journal _Integers_; submission does not imply acceptance or publication. The archived PDF, the accompanying manuscript record, and its factual AI-use statement are preserved. The journal's [current AI-use policy](https://math.colgate.edu/~integers/submit.html) **excludes AI-produced mathematics, code, bibliography, or other substantive content** (except basic spelling and grammar tools); substantive AI involvement in the P010 project is documented. Editorial eligibility has **not** been established by the acknowledgement of submission. See the [corrected submission-policy note](manuscripts/P010-2026-10-29-submission-snapshot-and-policy-audit.md).

## Problem folders

Problems are classified by mathematical subject. Detailed folders collect proofs, exploration, references, verification and optional formalization files. Examples are [P015 (geometry)](problems/geometry/P015-odd-area-triangulations/README.md), [P020 (number theory)](problems/number-theory/P020-padic-hankel-cokernels/README.md) and [P047 (topology)](problems/topology/P047-perfect-algebraic-fusion/README.md). Earlier single-file dossiers remain accessible as historical records.

A contributor may [submit a proposed problem](https://github.com/gsidoine/the-scottish-book/issues/new?template=propose-problem.yml) using Markdown or TeX, select a mathematical field, describe sources and AI involvement, and suggest an optional symbolic reward. A moderator can convert an issue into a draft PR; proposals are not automatically admitted to the book.

## Historical inspiration

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/Banach.jpg" alt="Historical portrait of mathematician Stefan Banach" width="350">
</p>

Stefan Banach was one of the mathematicians associated with the Scottish Café in Lwów, where mathematical problems were recorded in a shared notebook. This contemporary collection takes its name from that tradition; it is not an edition of the original book or its official continuation. See [the historical Scottish Book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-22897-6) and the [image provenance notes](assets/README.md).

## Literature and verification

The [P001–P050 mathematical merit review](audits/P001-P050-mathematical-merit-review.md) examines the substance and precision of every numbered statement, including four demotions. The [P001–P050 literature comparison](audits/P001-P050-literature-comparison.md) records principal known predecessors and historical-priority uncertainty. It does not certify novelty or unresolved status.

The [specialist scrutiny of P020–P050](audits/P020-P050-specialist-priority-gates.md) distinguishes proved resolutions from adjacent literature for the principal current candidates. In particular, P048 is resolved by classical prime-reflection pairing and is not an open prize question.

### Historical source reviews

The [P001–P020 consolidation](audits/2026-10-29-P001-P020-first-collection-consolidation.md), [P001–P025 literature gate](audits/2026-10-29-P001-P025-literature-source-gate.md), and [P001–P030 portfolio consolidation](audits/portfolio-consolidation-P001-P030.md) are historical audits, not the current curation. Their mathematical and bibliographic conclusions are retained as research records.

The [P001–P041 literature comparison](audits/literature-comparison-P001-P041.md) is a historical review, not a current certification of the full catalogue. Individual entries carry their own closest sources and verification links. [P010's manuscript information](manuscripts/P010/README.md) preserves its submission status and archival checksum.

## Problem catalogue

This is the **single numbered catalogue of all 50 entries**. The canonical catalogue is [data/problems.json](data/problems.json); its derived tables and [GitHub Pages browser](https://gsidoine.github.io/the-scottish-book/) are generated.

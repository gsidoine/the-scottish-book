## Main theorem

For a permutation $a=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ of $[n]$, let $h(n)$ be the minimum number of consecutive coprime pairs across all such permutations. The manuscript proves that, for every $n\ge4$,

$$
h(n)=\pi(n)-\pi(n/2)+
\max\{1,\lceil(\pi(n/2)-\pi(n/3))/2\rceil\}.
$$

In particular, $h(n)\sim 7n/(12\log n)$.

The proof interprets $h(n)$ as the minimum path-cover number of the non-coprime graph minus one. It derives a matching lower bound from isolated vertices and prime leaves and constructs an optimal path cover by grouping vertices according to largest prime factor.

**Journal policy clarification (verified 6 November 2026).** The [official INTEGERS AI-use guideline](https://math.colgate.edu/~integers/submit.html) excludes articles involving AI in the production of mathematics, computer code, bibliography, or other substantive content; basic language/spelling tools are exempt. The repository documents substantive AI assistance during P010's mathematical development. The editorial acknowledgement is not an eligibility determination. The author should ensure that the Managing Editor has accurate information about the scope of that assistance. The [dated policy correction](../P010-2026-10-29-submission-snapshot-and-policy-audit.md) documents the distinction. **The archived submitted PDF is unchanged.**
